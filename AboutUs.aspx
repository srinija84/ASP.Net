                     Network security consists of the provisions and policies adopted by a network administrator 
        to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer 
        network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of&nbsp; 
        access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose 
        or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them&nbsp; 
        access to information and programs within their authority. Network security covers a variety 
        of computer networks, both public and private, that are used in everyday jobs conducting  
        transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals. 
        Networks can be private, such as within a company, and others which might be open to public 
        access. Network security is involved in organizations, enterprises, and other types of 
        institutions. It does as its title explains: It secures the network, as well as protecting 
        and overseeing operations being done. The most common and simple way of protecting a network&nbsp; 
        resource is by assigning it a unique name and a corresponding password. </span>
